- CPU or NVIDIA GPU
- pytorch 2.1.2
- CUDA 11.8

## üíæ Datasets
### GT-RAIN
- Publicly Available real-world de-raining dataset
- Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NSRl954QPcGIgoyJa_VjQwh_gEaHWPb8)

### WeatherStream
- Publicly Available real-world multi-weather dataset, including rain, snow, and fog
- Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O8lTwsFwLftwMIygZS8H-xZAf2f6aL2b?usp=sharing)

## üìé Pre-trained weights
- Pre-trained weights trained on these two datasets
- Download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O8lTwsFwLftwMIygZS8H-xZAf2f6aL2b?usp=sharing)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Testing
- Prepare pre-trained weights
- Run the following code to restore weather degradation
- Average PSNR and SSIM metrics for scenes and different weather types will be automatically computed
```
python test.py
```
## ü§ñ Training
- Preparing training set
- Check training set and output weight paths in train.py, then run
```
python train.py
```
